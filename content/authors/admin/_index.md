My primary professional interests are in Bayesian Statistics, Network Psychometrics, R programming and Machine Learning or, even better, a combination of the four! I am a fan of a "common ground" approach regarding the polarization of Statistics in the form of *"Frequentist vs Bayesian"* (even though Centrism, in general, is not my cup of tea, I believe it might work when it comes to Statistics). You can see more of what I do on my GitHub profile or you can also read my CV. Feel free to contact me with any questions you might have regarding my research/work. I am open for research collaboration, consultations, teaching, or just having a chat about statistics, data and society.
