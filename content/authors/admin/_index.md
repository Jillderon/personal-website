I am a PhD student at the Department of Psychological Methods of the University of Amsterdam. I am working on a project devoted to developing a new methodology for Bayesian estimation of graphical models (for more details see [this](https://bayesiangraphicalmodeling.com/) page). My primary research interests are in Bayesian Statistics, Network Psychometrics, R programming and Machine Learning and their combination in enhancing research methods in Psychology and the Social Sciences in general. I am open to research collaboration, consultations, teaching, or just having a chat about statistics, data and society.
